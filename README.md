What I learned in GIT Features
> Github is most popular for developers. They share and work on their projects here.
> It is free.
> We can create branches here but the default is the master and that is the final.
> We can create feature branch when working on a specific/part of the whole project.
> With pull request, your team mates or senior can review the code/files sent before approving and merging it to the master branch.
